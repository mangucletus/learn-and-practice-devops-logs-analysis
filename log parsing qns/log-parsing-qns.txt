DevOps/SRE Log Parsing Practice Questions
1. Count All Successful GET Requests
Write a function that parses the log file and returns the number of successful GET requests. A successful
request has status code 200.

Expected Output:
125




2. Top 3 Resources by Request Count
Write a function to find the top 3 most accessed resources (e.g., /login, /home). Sort by the number of
requests in descending order.

Expected Output:
/login 430
/home 215
/register 174



3. Requests per 15-minute Window
Group the log entries into non-overlapping 15-minute windows and count the number of requests per window.

[03/Jun/2025:10:00 - 10:15] -> 95
[03/Jun/2025:10:15 - 10:30] -> 87



4. Sort IPs by Total Requests
Write a function that returns a list of IP addresses sorted by the total number of requests made in descending
order.
Expected Output:
192.168.1.5 -> 102
185.195.59.88 -> 98



5. Identify Most Active User Agents
Identify the top 2 most frequently occurring user agents from the log.
Expected Output:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; ...) -> 200
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT ...) -> 134


6. Count 404 Errors per Endpoint
Identify the endpoints that resulted in 404 status codes and count how many times each occurred.
Expected Output:
/notfound -> 45
/unknown -> 12



7. IPs with More Than 10 Failed Requests in 5 Minutes
Detect IPs with more than 10 requests returning 4xx or 5xx within any 5-minute window.
Expected Output:
185.195.59.88 -> 12 failures (10:00 - 10:05)


8. Average Number of Bytes Sent per Resource
Calculate the average number of bytes sent (if available) per resource. Ignore entries with '-' in the bytes field.
Expected Output:
/login -> 235
/home -> 178


9. Hour with Peak Traffic
Determine the hour of the day with the highest number of requests.
Expected Output:
10:00 - 11:00 -> 240 requests


10. First Request Timestamp per IP
Find the first request timestamp for each unique IP address.
Expected Output:
185.195.59.88 -> 2025-06-03T10:08:47.318Z
192.168.1.10 -> 2025-06-03T10:12:34.111Z

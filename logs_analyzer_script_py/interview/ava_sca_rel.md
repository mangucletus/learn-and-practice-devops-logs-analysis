# Difference Between High Availability, Scalability and High Reliability

**Availability** is a measure of the ability of a system or service to be operational and accessible when required for use. It is typically as a percentage and represents the ration of the time a system is available for use to the total time it should be available, considering both planned and unplanned downtime.

**Reliability** refers to the ability of a system, component or process to perform its inquired functions under stated conditions for a specified period. In simpler terms, it's about how well something works and how likely it is to keep working without breaking down or failing. Reliability is crucial in ensuring that systems perform consistently and meet the expectations of users or stakeholders. Reliability in cloud computing is important for businesses of any size. Buggy software can cause lost productivity, lost revenue, and lost trust in your brand. Before you deploy your applications to the cloud, make sure they are thoroughly tested against a variety of real-world scenarios. This helps to ensure that they are reliable and will meet customer expectations.

**For example**, let’s say you have an online store that is available 24/7. But sometimes clicking the “checkout” button kicks customers out of the system before they have completed the purchase. So, your store may be available all the time, but if the underlying software is not reliable, your cloud offerings are basically useless.

**Scalability** refers to how well your system can react and adapt to changing demands. As your company grows, you want to be able to seamlessly add resources without losing quality of service or interruptions. As demand on your resources decreases you want to quickly and efficiently downscale your system so you dont continue  to pay for resources you dont need.


**Bringing it all together**
Cloud availability, cloud reliability, and cloud scalability all need to come together to achieve high availability. This means that your products and services are accessible anytime and anywhere, function reliably and as expected, and that the system can seamlessly scale up or down to accommodate customer demand without suffering a loss in performance.

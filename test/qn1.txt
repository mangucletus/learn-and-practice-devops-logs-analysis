each log file ( eg. events.log, traffic.log, etc.) contains details about http requests made to the server, including the date, time, request type, file requested, protocol version. status code, and the size of the returned object in bytes.

Each log line in any of these log files is formatted as follows:

[15/Sep/2023:13:25:34 -0400] "POST /upload/file HTTP/1.1" 201 48299

. The first part ([15/Sep/2023:13:25:34 -0400]) is the timestamp.
. "POST /upload/file HTTP/1.1" is the request line, including the HTTP method, file requested, and protocol version.
. 201 is the HTTP status code.
. 48290 is the size of the returned object in bytes.

you are working with web server log files located in the /var/logs/ directory. 
each log file ( eg. events.log, traffic.log, etc.) contains details about http requests made to the server, including the date, time, request type, file requested, protocol version. status code, and the size of the returned object in bytes.

Each log line in any of these log files is formatted as follows:

[15/Sep/2023:13:25:34 -0400] "POST /upload/file HTTP/1.1" 201 48299
WHERE:

. The first part ([15/Sep/2023:13:25:34 -0400]) is the timestamp.
. "POST /upload/file HTTP/1.1" is the request line, including the HTTP method, file requested, and protocol version.
. 201 is the HTTP status code.
. 48290 is the size of the returned object in bytes.

Task
Calculate the total number of successful POST requests in the log file events.log

Output
The function solution should return an integer representing the total number of the successful POST requests found in the events.log

complete the solution below with the question above

def solution():
  #implement the solution here
  return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
   print(solution)








Expected Output:

[
    "/api/v1/orders:6400:3",
    "/api/v1/users:2560:2", 
    "/api/v1/products:768:1"
]

Explanation:

/api/v1/orders: 3 requests, total bytes = 2048 + 2560 + 1792 = 6400
/api/v1/users: 2 requests, total bytes = 1024 + 1536 = 2560
/api/v1/products: 1 request, total bytes = 768
Sorted by request count (descending): 3, 2, 1
Within same count, sorted lexicographically
